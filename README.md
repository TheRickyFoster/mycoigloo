# ❄️🍄 MycoIgloo: Thermal-Optimized Mycelium Growth Pods

**MycoIgloo™** is a modular, thermally-optimized mycelium growth and deployment system inspired by the thermal mechanics of igloos. Designed for regenerative biotech applications in cold or off-grid environments, MycoIgloo enables resilient fungal cultivation using waste heat, passive insulation, and adaptive airflow principles.

All systems are released under a non-resale, healing-use-only license aligned with planetary restoration goals.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

| Igloo Concept | Myco Translation | Benefit |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Snow = aerated matrix | Biofoam/perlite insulation | Low thermal conductivity |
| Dome shape | Geodesic/elliptic shells | Reduced surface area loss |
| Ice glazing interior | Hydrophilic inner skin | Moisture retention |
| Stack effect venting | Passive CO₂ exchange | Supports fungal respiration |
| Centralized heat zone | Compost or waste-stack heat | Colonization band stability |

## 🌡️ Environmental Control Parameters

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Temperature | 18–26°C (species-specific) | Stable gradient required |
| Humidity | 85–95% | Wicking liners & mist pulses |
| CO₂ ppm | <10,000 ppm | Affects morphology |
| Air Exchange | 2–6x/day minimum | Passive or micro-fan driven |
| Condensation | Recycled internally | Drip channels + UV loop |
