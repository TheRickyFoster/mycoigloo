# ❄️🍄 MycoIgloo: Thermal-Optimized Mycelium Growth Pods

**MycoIgloo™** is a modular, thermally-optimized mycelium growth and deployment system inspired by the thermal mechanics of igloos. Designed for regenerative biotech applications in cold or off-grid environments, MycoIgloo enables resilient fungal cultivation using waste heat, passive insulation, and adaptive airflow principles.

All systems are released under a non-resale, healing-use-only license aligned with planetary restoration goals.

## 🧰 Overview

**MycoIgloo** merges ancient architectural thermodynamics with advanced fungal biotechnology. It serves as a cold-resistant growth unit for mycelium species used in:

- Atmospheric filtration  
- Soil regeneration  
- Decentralized biofilter arrays  
- Edible mushroom cultivation  
- DAO-aligned biotechnical deployments

## 🎯 Purpose & Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ❄️ Cold-climate spawn nurseries | Maintain viable colonization temps with minimal external heat |
| 🔥 Stack-integrated biofilters | Wrap industrial exhaust stacks with layered myco-shells |
| 🧳 Portable fungal labs | Flat-packable igloo systems for remote site deployments |
| 🌱 Regenerative seeders | Freeze-deployed “snow core capsules” that activate in spring |
| 🧪 Off-grid biotech | Fully passive or low-power fungal reactors for rural ecosystems |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

| Igloo Concept | Myco Translation | Benefit |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Snow = aerated matrix | Biofoam/perlite insulation | Low thermal conductivity |
| Dome shape | Geodesic/elliptic shells | Reduced surface area loss |
| Ice glazing interior | Hydrophilic inner skin | Moisture retention |
| Stack effect venting | Passive CO₂ exchange | Supports fungal respiration |
| Centralized heat zone | Compost or waste-stack heat | Colonization band stability |

---

## 🌡️ Environmental Control Parameters

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Temperature | 18–26°C (species-specific) | Stable gradient required |
| Humidity | 85–95% | Wicking liners & mist pulses |
| CO₂ ppm | <10,000 ppm | Affects morphology |
| Air Exchange | 2–6x/day minimum | Passive or micro-fan driven |
| Condensation | Recycled internally | Drip channels + UV loop |

## 🚀 Rapid Prototyping Instructions

**Weekend Bench Test (v0.1):**

1. Use an insulated cooler as the shell.  
2. Drill top vent + filter-covered side intake.  
3. Install reptile heating mat or compost jar.  
4. Insert temp & humidity probes at 3 radii.  
5. Run colonized bags of substrate (grain-to-sawdust mix).  
6. Track thermal retention + CO₂ trends for 72h.  
7. Compare loose-fill insulation (perlite, foam, straw, shredded paper).  
8. Refine airflow based on passive stack effect performance.
